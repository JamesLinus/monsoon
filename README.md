Just a handful of lisp functions for now, intended to be run from
the REPL. I'll throw together a friendly command line interface
for it soon. 

* Conti's tool is also described in [this slideshow](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-06/bh-eu-06-Conti/bh-eu-06-conti.pdf), given at Black Hat.
